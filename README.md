This project involves the development of a data warehouse and star schema to manage and analyze the donation data collected during a pet rescue organizationâ€™s annual fundraising campaign. The data was sourced from six CSV files, cleansed, and imported into SQL to generate actionable insights through SQL queries, helping optimize the organization's fundraising strategies.
